			Really impressed with the quality and performance. It’s rare to find something that works this well straight out of the box. Would buy again without hesitation.

			Pretty solid overall. Setup was easy, and it’s been running smoothly. Just wish the battery life was a bit longer, but not a dealbreaker.
